    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>In researching the redesign I interviewed ten Craiglist users and asked them to name three things they liked about their experience with Craigslist and three things that they did not like. They liked that craigslist is to the point without added fluff in its design. They felt that the UX flow is very practical and easy to navigate. And, they liked that there is no clutter from outside adds. What they didn't like was the lack of visual hiarchy, they felt overwhelmed by the amount of text and that the site doesnt work well on mobile. </p>

    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <p>As we worked out the new wireframes for the site some of the major changes included moving the search bar to the center of the screen and planning out how the site would respond to different sized screens.  </p>
