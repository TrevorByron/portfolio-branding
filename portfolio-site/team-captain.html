    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>A few months ago my wife and I began pulling our monthly budget out in cash, dividing the money into seperate envelopes marked "groceries" "gas" etc. The issues we ran into was often forgeting to bring the envelopes to the store or one person having the envelope when the other needs it.</p>
    <h3>My Solution</h3>
    <p>The Bucket Budget app allows users to set up a monthly budget by creating seperate "buckets" that when selected money will be drawn from that bucket alone. Linked to your bank account it allows couples with a shared account to use the app at the same time. Following the Dave Ramsey Envelope method this allows users to see the limits of their accounts and regain controll of their spending.</p>
