    <h3>The Problem </h3>
    <p>As the Fast-Packing community grows, they do not have an online resource to read more about them sport, help them plan trips, find latest lightweight gear review or simply keep up with what the rest of the community is up to. <p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>I created an immersive website where those interested in Fast-Packing can come and learn more about the sport, get lots of inspiration through stories and photos and find help planing their first trip. Veteran Fast-Packers can come and read up on latest gear reviews and search for new exciting routes to run.

<h3>Designing the Experience</h3>
<p class="eightfifty"> I had three main ojectives while designing Fast-Packer.com: <br><br>
<b>1. I aimed to create a navigation system throughout the site that felt straight forward as well as natural. I wanted users to feel in control, navigating to where they want, while at the same time, creating a natural flow that lead users through the content.</b> <br>I did this by creating multiple routes to get to the same destination. I kept the traditional fixed header so users always had a clear path and added secondary navigation when content naturally lead users to drill deeper into a subject. <br><br>
<b>2. I wanted to the site to be asthetically beautiful and reflective of the natural environment in which fast-packing exists. I wanted large photos, natual colors and dynamic interactions between content that would create the feeling of depth, reminicent of the natural world.</b> <br> I created depth by emplementing a parallax effect, making different elements scroll at slower speeds, to create the illusion that large landscpae scenes being farther away from the veiwer. <br><br>
<b>3. I wanted to create a space that users who are in a rush, looking for information, would be able to quickly find what they were looking for. At the same time, I wanted to give the users who visit the site to leisurely browse and explore lots of content and photos to miander through.</b><br>  Wherever possible I used illustration and icons to to create patterns and consistency throughout the user's experience on the site and aid in their ability to quicky scan for the details they are looking for.</p>
